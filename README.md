## How does this work?
Add your train's name in the `Train Name` field and its destination in the `Destination` field.  It will show on the table and be added to the database.
Enter the time your train first arrives in the `First Train Time` field and how often the train shows up (in minutes) in the `Frequency` field.
The train's next arrival time and how many minutes away will be calculated and show up in the table.
